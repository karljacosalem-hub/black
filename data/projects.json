Their decision process still lived in disconnected spreadsheets, analyst notes, and static reports exported from different vendors. During weekly reviews, partners spent more time reconciling conflicting numbers than debating strategy. The business problem was not a lack of intelligence; it was a lack of shared operational truth. They needed a system that could surface the same baseline data to portfolio managers, finance leads, and compliance stakeholders without forcing each group into a separate interface language.",
      "The challenge was especially sensitive because credibility with limited partners depended on consistent communication. When one performance figure changed between meetings, confidence eroded quickly. Nova did not want a decorative dashboard. They needed an internal command surface that treated data lineage, audit traceability, and interpretation speed as equally important. Our brief focused on three outcomes: reduce reconciliation time before investment committees, make risk posture readable in under five minutes, and give leadership a narrative-ready output format for board and LP updates without manual reformatting."

        "description": "We started by documenting the actual decision moments that mattered: rebalancing thresholds, liquidity alerts, sector concentration reviews, and scenario planning before committee calls. Instead of designing pages first, we designed a sequence of decisions and built interface states around those moments. This kept the product grounded in business behavior rather than feature inventory. The resulting information architecture reduced duplicate modules and made each panel accountable to a specific operating question."

Interaction design favored low-motion transitions, keyboard-first navigation, and state persistence across sessions. We also introduced progressive disclosure for complex models, allowing users to inspect details on demand without overwhelming top-level review views.",
